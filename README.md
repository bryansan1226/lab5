 This program pulls the names and artist names of the top 200 songs of a certain week
and creates a file listing these songs, alphabetically sorted by name. The songs are added 
to a binary search tree as a "Song" node that includes the name of the song and the name of the artist.
Since the nodes are added to the tree based on the song name, performing an in order traversal returns
an alphabetically sorted list.
